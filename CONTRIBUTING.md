## Adding a New Event

Edit `data/events.yaml` and add a new entry following the existing format:

```yaml
- id: "9"
  title: "Your Event Name"
  description: "A brief description of the event."
  date: "2026-05-01"
  time: "18:00"
  location: "Venue Name, City"
  region: "City Name"
  category: "Technology"
  url: "https://example.com/your-event"
  tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2
```

Then run `npm run generate` to update the JSON, and open a Pull Request. CI
will validate the YAML and run tests automatically.
